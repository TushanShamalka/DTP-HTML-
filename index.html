         <p id="try">
            Traditionally known inMāori as upukemoana is a heart-shaped freshwater lake occupying a volcanic crater (or maar) situated to the east of Westlake Boys High School.
            The heart shape is a result of its formation by the linking of two circular craters - a larger one forming most of the lake and a smaller one forming the arm in the
            northeast. Separated from the sea by less than 200m at one point, it has a circumference of about 4.5km and reaches 57m in depth. It is popular for recreational
            activities and the lake front property around it.
